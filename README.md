This repository demonstrates a common, subtle bug in Python: a comparison function that fails to handle the case where the input values are equal.

The `my_function` function intends to return the larger of two numbers. However, it does not explicitly handle the scenario when `a` and `b` are equal, returning `a` in that case.

The solution provides a corrected version of the function which checks for equality and return one of them.
